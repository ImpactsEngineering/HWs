This is part of the process.**\n\n## Part a\n* Read in the data_2.txt file from D2L. Note that files can be uploaded to Azure as datasets and then read into the notebook.\n* Recall that the first data point in the file is the step associated with each additional data point. It needs to be deleted from your data before going further.\n* In order to plot the data, you will need an array for your X-axis. Create one in agreement with the timestep.\n\n## Part b\n* Plot the data from the file vs the X-axis array your created in Part a.\n* Remember to put \"%matplotlib inline\" (without the quotes) at the beginning so your plots display inline.\n\n## Part c\n* You may notice that the data looks like it repeats.\n* Trim this down to only a few repeated events and replot the data.\n* Add axis labels and a chart title. (What is this data representing?)\n\n## Finishing Up / Submission\nTo turn in this homework, click \"File\" at the top and then \"Download as\" > \"PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)\".
